add plan.sh inside the habitat.

need to add the run hook /habitat/hooks/run 
copy the run file from some other service directory from the above path.

Need to add the habitat/default.toml file 


Need to add some of the entries in product.meta

command to build the service 
============================
 rebuild components/keyval-service


we need to build the deployment service as well
  - when we do any change in the product.meta or we add package.meta we have to 
  run the make generate command from the automate-deployment directory. 




some db command
===============
chef-automate dev psql chef_license_control_service -- -c "select * from licenses;”

chef-automate dev psql data_feed_service -- -c "select * from data_feed_service;”
